Personal book management tools.





### Conventions
1. '-' is the separator, **not optional** must have it even without publisher, etc. (must have 4 '-')
-  use `_` instead of space for multiple author names
-  tree style management for subjects (D. Mathematics - DA. Analysis)
-  name for books:
    delimiter is like AB01, the character represents the subject while the number is largely arbitrary (by the date it was added to the library),

    FILE_TYPE: pdf, equb, djvu, etc.

    PUBLISHER is optional

    DELIMITER.bookName_part1-author1_author2-PublishYear-[Publisher].FILE_TYPE
                   _vol1


### Principles
